# 21stInventory

Created as a capstone project for CS4624 in Dr. Edward Fox's Multimedia/Hypertext course.  Kimberley Homer was our client at Network Infrastructure Services (NIS at Virginia Tech).  

Solves the problem of how to manage a large number of hardware devices, specifically wireless access points, across the Virginia Tech campus by giving the user the ability to scan a barcode and automatically be brought to a screen where the user can enter the corresponding data for a particular item, then have that item to added (or, if already a part of the database, modify that particular item) to the database.  

Built as an iOS app using XCode and tying into Google's Spreadsheet API, this app can run on either iPad or iPhone (although, under current setting on 8/17/15, iPad is the only supported version).
